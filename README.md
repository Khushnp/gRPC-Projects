# gRPC-Projects
Here one is server and other two are the clients 
(One is simple console client and another is in-memory crud operation using List only ).
SimpleTalkGrpcWebClient --> is the crud operation project
GrpcService1_SimpleTalkGrpcService --> is the server project common for both the clients
ConsoleApp_Client_WorkingWithServer --> is the console project.
to run any project first we need to run the server project than we can run any of the above project to get the output.

Fourth Project is the GrpcServer so it is the server for the GrpcSClient named project
this will run if grpcserver starts first and than the grpcclient...
